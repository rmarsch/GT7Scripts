AFK Autohotkey Scripts

## PanAm

This script drives the Dodge SRT Tomahawk S VGT around the track hugging the wall.

It's a community script that I've made a few modifications to:
* Configurable initial delay before starting to turn. (To adjust how you go around the Ford Focus at start)
* Pixel detector for selecting the championship instead of just trying X right or left directional presses (which can get lost on remote play desync)
* GUI change for setting the initial turn variable and for seeing what color the pointer color is for the championship pixel detector
